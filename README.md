# Real-Time Retail Sales Analytics with Azure and Power BI

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end data engineering pipeline built on Microsoft Azure. The pipeline ingests, processes, and visualizes a large retail sales dataset in real-time, simulating a modern business intelligence environment.

The core of the project involves significant preprocessing using Excel Power Query, followed by streaming this data via a Python script running on an Azure Virtual Machine.

## Objective

The goal is to provide "Global Retail Inc.," a fictional e-commerce company, with a dynamic, real-time analytics dashboard. This solution replaces static, end-of-day reports, empowering the business to monitor sales performance, identify trending products, and track regional performance as it happens.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a modern data platform architecture, where data flows from a source, through a processing pipeline, and into a visualization layer.

### Data Flow:

Python Script on Azure VM **‚Üí** Azure Event Hubs **‚Üí** Azure Stream Analytics **‚Üí** Azure SQL Database **‚Üí** Power BI Dashboard

## üìä Data Source & Preprocessing

The project utilizes the HyperStore Dataset, which contains retail sales transactions. Before the data was ready for the pipeline, it underwent extensive cleaning, augmentation, and transformation.

All preprocessing steps were performed using Excel Power Query.

### 1. Data Augmentation

The original dataset contained approximately 5,000 records. To simulate a more realistic, high-volume data stream, the dataset was augmented with 550000 synthetic records. These new records were generated by randomly sampling existing values from each column, increasing the total dataset size to ~600000 records.

### 2. Handling Missing Values

A thorough check for null or missing values was conducted across all columns. Any rows containing null values were dropped to ensure data integrity and prevent errors during processing.

### 3. Duplicate Removal

The dataset was checked for duplicate rows. All identified duplicates were removed to ensure that each transaction in the dataset was unique.

### 4. Feature Engineering (Column Splitting)

To make the data more meaningful and usable for analysis, two key columns were split to create more granular features:

- **Region Country** Column: This column, containing values like "East Mexico", was split into two new columns:

  - **Region** (e.g., "East")
  - **Country** (e.g., "Mexico")

- **SegmentCategory** Column: This column, containing combined values like "Consumer;Furniture;", was split into two new columns:

  - **Segment** (e.g., "Consumer")
  - **Category** (e.g., "Furniture")

This feature engineering makes it much easier to filter and analyze data by specific regions, countries, segments, or product categories in the final dashboard.

## üöÄ Pipeline Execution

The data streaming is driven by a Python script (**send_data.py**) which is executed on a **Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)** Virtual Machine hosted in **Azure**.

The script reads the preprocessed and augmented CSV file, iterates through each row, converts it to a JSON object, and sends it to an Azure Event Hub. This setup simulates a real-world application server sending live transaction data to a dedicated ingestion service.

## üìà Visualization

The final output is an interactive dashboard built in Power BI.

The dashboard connects to the Azure SQL Database using DirectQuery mode. This ensures that the visuals are always displaying the latest data as it arrives, providing a true real-time view of sales performance.

### Dashboard Features:

- KPI Cards: High-level metrics for Total Revenue, Net Profit, and Units Sold.
- Time Series Analysis: Dual-axis line charts showing trends for "Revenue and Profit By Month" and "Revenue and Units Sold By Month".
- Product Performance: Bar charts displaying the "Top 5 Best Selling Products" and "Top 5 Worst Selling Products" to quickly identify key items.
- Sales Distribution: Donut charts breaking down "Total Revenue by Segment" and "Total Revenue by Category".
- Interactive Slicers: Dynamic filters for Region (North America/South America) and Year, allowing for deep-dive analysis across the entire dashboard.
